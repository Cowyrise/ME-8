# Object Tracking and Detecting System

The program basically detects distinct objects and stores their location through a spline algorithm. This project includes 2 parts: the code and the 2 brackets to mount the camera and HEBI motors which provides the system 2 degrees of freedom. This project is controlled through a Raspberry Pi microcontroller.

> Note: the code and parts are all compiled in a pdf form instead of the original code for honor code purposes
